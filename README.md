This video is a summation of video tutorials that I have composed together on everything I realized about trying to make self-driving cars in Unity with the help of Neural Networks (MLAgents library) I go step by step as similar to my learning process of the material. I plan to use the new knowledge to make a proper exciting racing car game.
